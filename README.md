# Healthcare-Access-Project-
This Power BI project analyzes healthcare accessibility in Africa, with a focus on urban vs. rural disparities. The goal is to visualize data to identify challenges and provide actionable insights for equitable healthcare delivery.
# Objectives
• Analyze facility distribution, funding, and workforce availability.

• Identify key disparities in healthcare access.

• Provide insights and recommendations for policy improvement.

___
# Process Overview 

### 1. Data cleaning and preparation 
   Dataset provided by **Axia Africa** for this project. Dataset consist of:
   
• 2000 Rows

• 13 Column

• I Imported CSV file into Power BI.

• Verified data types and cleaned missing values (none found).

• Added a new column to classify regions into Urban or Rural based on population, electricity, internet availability, and distance to facility.

### 2. Dashboard Design
• Color Theme: Red and White

• Background: Off-white

• Primary: Medical Red (#E53935), Dark Red (#D32F2F)

• Secondary: Teal (#00838F)

### 2.1 Layout Highlights:

• KPIs (top-right): Total funding, Facility count by type, Average emergency response time

• Title and image (top-left)

• Country slicer (left panel)

___
# Insights
• Urban areas have nearly 3x more facilities (hospitals, clinics, health centers) than rural areas.

• Urban facilities receive more funding than rural ones.

• There is no correlation between funding and response time. High funding doesn’t guarantee faster emergency response times.

• Hospitals are most efficient (lowest cost per patient visit), followed by clinics. Health centers are the least efficient.

• Urban areas have significantly more workforce and accessories (doctors, nurses, and beds) than rural areas
___

# Challenges 

• Rural facilities are underfunded.

• Long distances to facilities.

• Poor infrastructure (electricity, internet, transport).

• Limited workforce in rural areas.
___

# Recommendations 

• Increase targeted funding in underserved rural regions.

• Offer workforce incentives (e.g., training, bonuses).

• Improve transportation services to enhance emergency response times.

• Establish regulatory bodies to track and audit healthcare funding allocation.
